<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>So far, learning web development has been both exciting and challenging. Right now with HTML it's okay and most devs would say this
this only the beginning and I am aware of that. I'd still say pretty cool.
Slowly building the skills step by step, and it’s been fun to see things come to life in the browser.</p>

<p> Before diving into web development, I had some experience with programming in C++. Which has given me a solid foundation in problem-solving and logic, 
but I’ve realized that web development feels more creative
like I’m building something people can actually see and use. 
I want to see how far I can go.</p>
